 $Log: pcibios_.sgml,v $
 Revision 1.9  1997/11/28 19:06:00  rincewind
 - find_multi_device removed. The bios can handle this transparent by
   reporting a single device (with a different handle) for each function.
 - the resource descriptors are back - Torsten correctly stated that they
   are necessary so that a driver can find out the length of a resource
   without writing to the config space of the card, which he is not allowed
   to (great thing, CVS :-))
 - callback: the state can be set back to 'free'. Added code for 'can be
   removed without callback'.
 - new: get_machine_id (Torsten's proposal)
 - removed interrupt line from (un)hook interrupt. The BIOS can read this
   from the config space of the device.

<sect>Introduction

<p>
This document describes the software interface which is used by drivers and
other system-oriented programs to get access to PCI cards present in the
system. Support for ISA and ISA PnP cards can be added without changes.

<sect1>Related Documents
<p>
<itemize>
<item>PCI Local Bus Specification, Revision 2.0 April 30, 1993
<item>PCI BIOS Specification, Revision 2.1, August 26, 1994
</itemize>

<sect>General
<sect1>Resources
<p>
All cards get their resources (memory and IO areas, interrupts) assigned
and set by the system. Drivers and other programs may <em/not/ modify these
settings.

<sect1>Calling Conventions
<p>
The PCI BIOS functions use the 680x0 CPU registers to pass arguments and to
return status.

The routines may modify only those registers which are used to pass
parameters or to return information in as specified for the specific
function, plus the status register.

The routines must be called in Supervisor mode, and the available stack
must be at least 1024 bytes.

The functions may disable interrupts during execution, but will return with
the interrupts in the same state as when they were called.

All functions return an error code in D0 if an error occurred.

<sect1>Device Handles
<p>
Every device on a PCI (or ISA) card is specified by using a device 
handle. The device handle is used as an opaque data type by the driver - no
assumptions are to be made about the meaning of bits in this value. 
device handles are positive 32-bit integers - negative values are used for
error codes for functions which return device handles.

<!---
 <tscreen><code>
devicehandle:
  Bit 7-0   Bus number
  Bit 10-8  Function number
  Bit 15-11 Device Number
  Bit 31-16 all '0'
</code></tscreen>            

For other cards (ISA-PnP etc.), bit 31-16 may have other meanings.
-->

<sect1>Locating the function entry points
<p>
The BIOS installs a "_PCI" cookie which points to the following structure
of entry points to the individual functions:

<tscreen><code>
dc.l  0                     ; $00 pointer to sub cookie jar (for 
                            ; compatibility) or 0 if not present
dc.l  1                     ; $04 version number of this structure
dc.l  find_pci_device       ; $08
dc.l  find_pci_classcode    ; $0C 
dc.l  read_config_byte     
dc.l  read_config_word     
dc.l  read_config_longword 
dc.l  fast_read_config_byte    
dc.l  fast_read_config_word    
dc.l  fast_read_config_longword
dc.l  write_config_byte     
dc.l  write_config_word     
dc.l  write_config_longword 
dc.l  hook_interrupt        
dc.l  unhook_interrupt      
dc.l  special_cycle
dc.l  get_routing           
dc.l  set_interrupt         
dc.l  get_resource          
dc.l  get_card_used       
dc.l  set_card_used
dc.l  read_mem_byte
dc.l  read_mem_word
dc.l  read_mem_longword
dc.l  write_mem_byte
dc.l  write_mem_word
dc.l  write_mem_longword
dc.l  read_io_byte
dc.l  read_io_word
dc.l  read_io_longword
dc.l  write_io_byte
dc.l  write_io_word
dc.l  write_io_longword
dc.l  get_machine_id
dc.l  virt_to_bus
dc.l  bus_to_virt
</code></tscreen>            

This structure, and the functions it points to, should be in ROM or some
other place which is safe from being overwritten (eg. above phystop), if it
is desirable that alternative Operating Systems can use the functions.

The circumstances for calling the functions may need to be specified
further for this case.

<sect1>Interrupt Handlers
<p>
For each hardware interrupt, there is a chain of interrupt handlers, as
multiple cards can share the same interrupt.

By specifying a device handle and an interrupt line
on that card (INTA - INTD), a driver can hook into the chain that handles
this interrupt without knowing which one it actually is.

When an interrupt occurs, the driver is called with a value in A0 which is
set by the driver when hooking into the interrupt. The meaning of this
parameter depends on the driver - it can be a device handle, a pointer to some
driver-internal data structure, etc..

<tscreen><code>
interrupt_handler:
Input:
  A0.L   value as passed to hook_interrupt
  D0.L   BIOS internal data
Output:
  D0.L   bit 0 set if the interrupt was from this card. D0 unmodified
         otherwise.
</code></tscreen>

The interrupt handler must not modify any register except D0 (only as
specified) and A0. 
If the interrupt was caused by the card which this handler is monitoring,
it must make sure that the card returns the interrupt line to inactive
state, and return with D0.0 set. <p>
If the card did not cause the interrupt, the driver must not modify D0.
<p>
The interrupt handler returns by using an RTS instruction.
<p>

<sect1>Error codes<p>
The following error codes can be returned by the PCI BIOS functions:
<tscreen><code>
 $00000000   PCI_SUCCESSFUL
 $FFFFFFFE   PCI_FUNC_NOT_SUPPORTED
 $FFFFFFFD   PCI_BAD_VENDOR_ID
 $FFFFFFFC   PCI_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND
 $FFFFFFFB   PCI_BAD_REGISTER_NUMBER
 $FFFFFFFA   PCI_SET_FAILED
 $FFFFFFF9   PCI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
 $FFFFFFF8   PCI_GENERAL_ERROR
 $FFFFFFF7   PCI_BAD_HANDLE
</code></tscreen>

<sect>PCI BIOS functions
<sect1>Find PCI device
<p>
This function returns a device handle for a device that
matches the given device and vendor ID.

A driver can query multiple devices with the same device and vendor ID by
starting with index 0 and calling this function until PCI_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND is
returned.

<tscreen><code>
find_pci_device:
Input:
  D0.L      Device ID in bits 15..0  (0 - $FFFF), 
            Vendor ID in bits 31..16 (0 - $FFFE)
  D1.W      Index (0 - # of cards with these IDs)
Output:
  D0.L      device handle or error code
</code></tscreen>

<sect1>Find PCI class code
<p>
This function returns a device handle for a device that
matches the given class code.

A driver can query multiple devices with the same class code by
starting with index 0 and calling this function until PCI_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND is
returned.

<tscreen><code>
find_pci_classcode:
Input:
  D0.L      class code in bits 23..0:
              Base class in bit 23..16 (0 - $FF),
              Sub  class in bit 15..8  (0 - $FF),
              Prog. If.  in bit  7..0  (0)
  D1.W      Index (0 - # of cards with these IDs)
Output:
  D0.L      device handle or error code
</code></tscreen>

<sect1>Read Configuration {Byte|Word|Longword}
<p>
These three functions read data from the PCI configuration space of a given
card.

!!!To do: specify if big or little endian addressing is used

<tscreen><code>
read_config_byte:
read_config_word:
read_config_longword:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle
  A0.L      pointer to space for read data
  D1.B      Register number (0,1,2,... for Byte access)
  D1.B      Register number (0,2,4,... for Word access)
  D1.B      Register number (0,4,8,... for Longword access)
Output:
  D0        error code (32 bits)
            read data at buffer pointed to by A0
</code></tscreen>

<sect1>Read Configuration {Byte|Word|Longword} FAST
<p>
These three functions read data from the PCI configuration space of a given
card. They do only minimal error checking and are meant to be used in
interrupt handlers.

!!!To do: specify if big or little endian addressing is used

<tscreen><code>
fast_read_config_byte:
fast_read_config_word:
fast_read_config_longword:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle
  D1.B      Register number (0,1,2,... for Byte access)
  D1.B      Register number (0,2,4,... for Word access)
  D1.B      Register number (0,4,8,... for Longword access)
Output:
  D0        read data (8, 16 or 32 bits)
  SR:       carry flag may be set if an error occurred 
            (implementation dependent)
</code></tscreen>


<sect1>Write Configuration {Byte|Word|Longword}
<p>
These three functions write data to the PCI configuration space of a given
card.

!!!To do: specify if big or little endian addressing is used

<tscreen><code>
write_config_byte:
write_config_word:
write_config_longword:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle
  D1.B      Register number (0,1,2,... for Byte access)
  D1.B      Register number (0,2,4,... for Word access)
  D1.B      Register number (0,4,8,... for Longword access)
  D2        data to write (8/16/32 bits)
Output:
  D0.L      error code
</code></tscreen>

<sect1>Hook Interrupt Vector
<p>
This function hooks the driver into the interrupt chain to which a specific
interrupt on the given card is routed. The interrupt is enabled on the
system level, however, it is the drivers responsibility to enable the
interrupt on the card itself as needed.

The driver should first hook into the interrupt chain, and then enable the
interrupt on the card, in order not to cause spurious interrupts.

<tscreen><code>
hook_interrupt:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle
  A0        pointer to interrupt handler
  A1        parameter for interrupt handler.
Output:
  D0.L      error code
</code></tscreen>
The parameter (from A1) is passed to the interrupt handler unmodified - its
meaning is totally driver dependent.


<sect1>Unhook Interrupt Vector
<p>
This function removes the driver from the interrupt chain to which a specific
interrupt on the given card is routed. The driver must turn off interrupt
generation on the card before calling this function.

<tscreen><code>
unhook_interrupt:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle 
Output:
  D0.L      error code
</code></tscreen>

<sect1>Generate Special Cycle
<p>
This function generates a special cycle on the PCI bus.

<tscreen><code>
special_cycle:
Input:
  D0.B      bus number
  D1.L      special cycle data
Output:
  D0.L      error code
</code></tscreen>

<sect1>Get Interrupt Routing Options
<p>
to be defined. Not for use by device drivers.

<sect1>Set Hardware Interrupt
<p>
to be defined. Not for use by device drivers.

<sect1>Get Resource Data<p>
This function returns data about the resources which a device uses. The
returned structure may <em/not/ be modified by the driver.

The driver can then use these information and directly access the device if
he knows the type of byte ordering, or it can use the system routines
(mem|io_read|write_...) which handle this transparently.

The function returns a pointer to the first resource descriptor for this
device. The driver can get the next descriptor by adding the length field
to the address of the current descriptor.

The descriptors are in the same order as the base address registers in the PCI
configuration space of the device.

If bit 15 of the flags is set, there is no next descriptor.

A device can have multiple resources of the same type. 

<tscreen><code>
get_resource:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle 
Output:
  D0.L      pointer to array of resource descriptors or error code
</code></tscreen>

The resource descriptors look like this:
<tscreen><code>
struct resource_descriptor:
  next      DS.W 1    ; length of this structure in bytes
                      ; Use this to get next descriptor
  flags     DS.W 1    ; type of resource and misc flags
  start     DS.L 1    ; start address of resource
  length    DS.L 1    ; length of resource
  offset    DS.L 1    ; offset from PCI to physical CPU address
  dmaoffset DS.L 1    ; offset for DMA-Memory transfers.
  private   DS.B n    ; private data, used only by the PCI BIOS. Do not touch.
</code></tscreen>

The <tt/flags/ field is bit-coded as follows:
<tscreen><code>
  RSC_IO      = $4000 ; This is an IO area (Memory area if bit is clear)
  RSC_LAST    = $8000 ; last resource for this device

  FLG_8BIT    = $0100 ; 8-bit accesses are supported
  FLG_16BIT   = $0200 ; 16-bit accesses are supported
  FLG_32BIT   = $0400 ; 32-bit accesses are supported
  FLG_ENDMASK = $000F ; Bit 0..3 specify which byte ordering is used:
                        0 = Motorola.
                        1 = Intel, address-swapped
                        2 = Intel, lane-swapped
                        3..14 = reserved
                        15 = unknown. Access card only via BIOS functions.
</code></tscreen>

The <tt/start/ field contains the start address on the PCI bus of the
resource. The <tt/length/ field contains its length.

The <tt/offset/ field contains the offset from physical CPU to PCI address
for the resource - ie. the value that must be added to the PCI address to
get the physical address in CPU address space.

The <tt/dmaoffset/ gives the offset that must be added to a PCI address to
get the physical address in CPU address space when doing DMA transfers.

!!! is this still needed, or should we use virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt
exclusively?

<sect2>What are all these byte orders?<p>

Motorola byte ordering (big endian) is what you would expect on a 680x0
system: 8/16/32 bit accesses work as expected.

When address-swapped Intel (little endian) byte ordering is used, 32 bit
accesses work without modifications. On 16 bit accesses, the address needs
to be XOR'd with a value of 2, on 8-bit accesses the address is XOR'd with
a value of 3. The data read or written is in correct format.

When lane-swapped Intel (little endian) byte ordering is used, the address
needs no modifications. 8-bit accesses work normal, on 16 and 32 bit
accesses the read or written data needs to be swapped (ror.w #8,d0 for
16 bit, ror.w d0:swap d0:ror.w d0 for 32 bit).






<sect1>Memory/IO Read/Write<p>
These functions read or write 8, 16 or 32-bit values from a memory or IO
region and take care of the byte ordering - ie. the data and address are
converted as if Motorola byte ordering was in use.

A driver can use these functions for access to registers and small
buffers. For larger amounts of data, the driver can choose to use his own
copy routines, provided it knows the byte order in use.

  D1.L      address to access (in physical CPU address space)
  A0.L      pointer to data in memory
Output:
  D0.L      error code
</code></tscreen>

<sect1>Example<p>
<itemize>
<item>use <tt/find_pci_device/ or <tt/find_pci_classcode/
to find out if there is a supported card and get a device handle for the
card
<item>use <tt/get_resource*/ to read the start address and length of a used
resource. 
<item>Now, either: add the offset from the resource descriptor to the
address to directly access the card.
<item>Or: use the read_*/write_* functions to access the card.
</itemize>

<sect>Driver support functions<p>
These functions are used to manage which card is in use by which driver. A
driver can provide a means by which a call-back function can be called from
another driver to deactivate this driver. This is necessary for the first
driver to unhook from interrupt chains etc., before the new driver can take
over.

<sect1>Get|Set card used flag<p>
<tscreen><code>
get_card_used:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle
  A0.L      pointer to longword where call-back address is stored
Output:
  D0.L      error code or status
</code></tscreen>

The returned status is either 0 (the card is free), 1 (the
card is in use), 2 (the card is in use, but the driver can be
uninstalled) or 3 (the card is in use, but can be taken over without further
actions). 

Case 3 means that the driver which brought the card to this state may not
hook into interrupt chains or other system resources which need to be
unhooked when another driver takes over the card.


If the return code is 2, the call-back function entry of the driver is
returned in the memory pointed to by A0.

<tscreen><code>
set_card_used:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle
  A0.L      address of call-back entry (not pointer to address!) 
            or 0L, 1L or 3L
Output:
  D0.L      error code
</code></tscreen>

If the call-back entry is 0L, 1L or 3L, the card status is set to that
value. Only a driver which 'owns' the card may use this.

If any other value is passed, it is assumed to be a pointer to the drivers
call back entry point, and the card status is set to 2 (in use, can be
uninstalled).

<sect1>Call-back handlers<p>
Call-back functions are invoked by calling the call-back entry point, they
return with RTS. Call-back functions may only modify those registers which
are used to pass arguments or results.

Call-back functions must be called in supervisor mode with at least 1024
bytes stack available.

The call-back function number is passed in D0.L.

If the driver supports call-back functions, the following functions are
mandatory:

<sect2>Call-back 0: Get Driver ID<p>
The driver returns his ID (4-byte ASCII, same as the XBRA ID) in D0.L.

<sect2>Call-back 1: Try to remove driver<p>
The driver tries to uninstall. If it succeeds, it returns 0 in D0.L and
sets the card status to 'free', otherwise, it returns 1.





<sect>Machine  ID<p>
This function can be used to get a unique machine ID for the computer the
driver is running on:

<tscreen><code>
get_machine_id:
Input:
  none
Output:
  D0.L      Machine ID, or 0 (no ID available), or error code
</code></tscreen>

Positive values are machine IDs. They contain a manufacturer code in bit
24..31 and a unique serial number which is set by the manufacturer during
production in bit 0..23.


<sect>PMMU support functions<p>
These functions convert from virtual addresses (as the CPU uses them) to
PCI bus addresses and back. This is necessary since the memory may be
mapped non-linear by the PMMU even when not using virtual memory (it is on
the MILAN).

These functions are limited to TOS or TOS-like operating systems. If an
operating systems uses a different memory layout, it will need to provide
its own functions which drivers can use.

When using these functions, the driver does not need to care about DMA
offsets at all.

<sect1>Convert virtual to PCI bus address<p>

<tscreen><code>
virt_to_bus:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle
  D1.L      address in virtual CPU space
Output:
  D0.L      length of contiguous mapped area, 0 if no DMA is possible 
            at this address
  D1.L      PCI bus address
</code></tscreen>

<sect1>Convert PCI bus to virtual address<p>

This function is the reverse of virt_to_bus. It might be slow, so the driver
should avoid using it if it can determine the address by other means.

<tscreen><code>
bus_to_virt:
Input:
  D0.L      device handle
  D1.L      PCI bus address
Output:
  D0.L      length of contiguous mapped area, 0 if an error occurred
  D1.L      CPU (virtual) address
</code></tscreen>

<sect>To do/Notes<p>
<itemize>
<item>Document get_routing and set_interrupt

<item>For non-PnP but soft-configured ISA cards, we might need a call by
which the driver can request a free IO or memory region, ISA interrupt
etc..

<item>Document a method to reassign resource allocations for broken cards.

<item>Should resource descriptors have a fixed length (I don't think so,
without the <tt/length/ field? This would make them easier to access, but
would make future extensions difficult or ugly.

<item>The machine ID is not PCI specific. Should the function be part of
the PCI BIOS, or should it placed somewhere else?

<item>Are there cards which need the fast_read_* functions (ie. access to
the PCI configuration area from an interrupt handler)? Otherwise, these
might as well be removed - especially as these can't be unimplemented, due
to the lack of error codes..
