other system-oriented programs to get access to PCI cards present in
Atari-compatible systems. Support for ISA and ISA PnP cards can be added without changes.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>This document describes the software interface which is used by drivers and
other system-oriented programs to get access to PCI cards present in the
system. Support for ISA and ISA PnP cards can be added without changes.
<P>
<H2>1.1 Related Documents</H2>

<UL>
<LI>PCI Local Bus Specification, Revision 2.0 April 30, 1993</LI>
<LI>PCI BIOS Specification, Revision 2.1, August 26, 1994</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="s2">2. General</A></H2>

<H2>2.1 Resources</H2>

<P>All cards get their resources (memory and IO areas, interrupts) assigned
and set by the system. Drivers and other programs may <EM>not</EM> modify these
settings.
<P>
<H2>2.2 Calling Conventions</H2>

<P>The PCI BIOS functions use the 680x0 CPU registers to pass arguments and to
return status.
<P>The routines may modify only those registers which are used to pass
parameters or to return information in as specified for the specific
function, plus the status register.
<P>The routines must be called in Supervisor mode, and the available stack
must be at least 1024 bytes.
<P>The functions may disable interrupts during execution, but will return with
the interrupts in the same state as when they were called.
<P>All functions return an error code in D0 if an error occurred.
<P>
<H2>2.3 Device Handles</H2>

<P>Every device on a PCI (or ISA) card is specified by using a device 
handle. The device handle is used as an opaque data type by the driver - no
assumptions are to be made about the meaning of bits in this value. 
device handles are positive 32-bit integers - negative values are used for
error codes for functions which return device handles.
<P>
<P>
<H2>2.4 Locating the function entry points</H2>

<P>The BIOS installs a "_PCI" cookie which points to the following structure
of entry points to the individual functions:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
dc.l  0                     ; $00 pointer to sub cookie jar (for 
                            ; compatibility) or 0 if not present
dc.l  1                     ; $04 version number of this structure

<P>This structure, and the functions it points to, should be in ROM or some
other place which is safe from being overwritten (eg. above phystop), if it
is desirable that alternative Operating Systems can use the functions.
<P>The circumstances for calling the functions may need to be specified
further for this case.
<P>
<H2>2.5 Interrupt Handlers</H2>

<P>For each hardware interrupt, there is a chain of interrupt handlers, as
multiple cards can share the same interrupt.
<P>By specifying a device handle and an interrupt line
on that card (INTA - INTD), a driver can hook into the chain that handles
this interrupt without knowing which one it actually is.
<P>When an interrupt occurs, the driver is called with a value in A0 which is
set by the driver when hooking into the interrupt. The meaning of this
parameter depends on the driver - it can be a device handle, a pointer to some
driver-internal data structure, etc..
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
interrupt_handler:
Input:
  A0.L   value as passed to hook_interrupt
  D0.L   BIOS internal data
Output:
  D0.L   bit 0 set if the interrupt was from this card. D0 unmodified
         otherwise.
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The interrupt handler must not modify any register except D0 (only as
specified) and A0. 
If the interrupt was caused by the card which this handler is monitoring,
it must make sure that the card returns the interrupt line to inactive
state, and return with D0.0 set. 
<P>If the card did not cause the interrupt, the driver must not modify D0.
<P>The interrupt handler returns by using an RTS instruction.
<P>
<P>
<H2>2.6 Error codes</H2>

<P>The following error codes can be returned by the PCI BIOS functions:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H2>3.6 Hook Interrupt Vector</H2>

<P>This function hooks the driver into the interrupt chain to which a specific
interrupt on the given card is routed. The interrupt is enabled on the
system level, however, it is the drivers responsibility to enable the
interrupt on the card itself as needed.
<P>The driver should first hook into the interrupt chain, and then enable the
interrupt on the card, in order not to cause spurious interrupts.

hook_interrupt:
Input:

meaning is totally driver dependent.

<H2>3.7 Unhook Interrupt Vector</H2>

<P>This function removes the driver from the interrupt chain to which a specific
interrupt on the given card is routed. The driver must turn off interrupt
generation on the card before calling this function.

<P>This function returns data about the resources which a device uses. The

he knows the type of byte ordering, or it can use the system routines

<P>The <CODE>start</CODE> field contains the start address on the PCI bus of the
resource. The <CODE>length</CODE> field contains its length.
<P>The <CODE>offset</CODE> field contains the offset from physical CPU to PCI address
for the resource - ie. the value that must be added to the PCI address to
get the physical address in CPU address space.
<P>The <CODE>dmaoffset</CODE> gives the offset that must be added to a PCI address to
get the physical address in CPU address space when doing DMA transfers.
<P>!!! is this still needed, or should we use virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt
exclusively?
<P>
<H3>What are all these byte orders?</H3>

<P>
<P>Motorola byte ordering (big endian) is what you would expect on a 680x0
system: 8/16/32 bit accesses work as expected.
<P>When address-swapped Intel (little endian) byte ordering is used, 32 bit
accesses work without modifications. On 16 bit accesses, the address needs
to be XOR'd with a value of 2, on 8-bit accesses the address is XOR'd with
a value of 3. The data read or written is in correct format.
<P>When lane-swapped Intel (little endian) byte ordering is used, the address
needs no modifications. 8-bit accesses work normal, on 16 and 32 bit
accesses the read or written data needs to be swapped (ror.w #8,d0 for
16 bit, ror.w d0:swap d0:ror.w d0 for 32 bit).
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2>3.12 Memory/IO Read/Write</H2>

<P>These functions read or write 8, 16 or 32-bit values from a memory or IO
region and take care of the byte ordering - ie. the data and address are
converted as if Motorola byte ordering was in use.
<P>A driver can use these functions for access to registers and small
buffers. For larger amounts of data, the driver can choose to use his own
copy routines, provided it knows the byte order in use.

<P>These functions are used to manage which card is in use by which driver. A

another driver to deactivate this driver. This is necessary for the first
driver to unhook from interrupt chains etc., before the new driver can take

</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The returned status is either 0 (the card is free), 1 (the
card is in use), 2 (the card is in use, but the driver can be
uninstalled) or 3 (the card is in use, but can be taken over without further
actions). 
<P>Case 3 means that the driver which brought the card to this state may not
hook into interrupt chains or other system resources which need to be
unhooked when another driver takes over the card.
<P>
<P>If the return code is 2, the call-back function entry of the driver is
returned in the memory pointed to by A0.

</PRE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If the call-back entry is 0L, 1L or 3L, the card status is set to that
value. Only a driver which 'owns' the card may use this.
<P>If any other value is passed, it is assumed to be a pointer to the drivers
call back entry point, and the card status is set to 2 (in use, can be
uninstalled).
<P>
<H2>4.2 Call-back handlers</H2>

<P>Call-back functions are invoked by calling the call-back entry point, they
return with RTS. Call-back functions may only modify those registers which
are used to pass arguments or results.
<P>Call-back functions must be called in supervisor mode with at least 1024
bytes stack available.
<P>The call-back function number is passed in D0.L.
<P>If the driver supports call-back functions, the following functions are
mandatory:
<P>
<H3>Call-back 0: Get Driver ID</H3>

<P>The driver returns his ID (4-byte ASCII, same as the XBRA ID) in D0.L.
<P>
<H3>Call-back 1: Try to remove driver</H3>

<P>The driver tries to uninstall. If it succeeds, it returns 0 in D0.L and

<P>These functions convert from virtual addresses (as the CPU uses them) to
PCI bus addresses and back. This is necessary since the memory may be
mapped non-linear by the PMMU even when not using virtual memory (it is on
the MILAN).
<P>These functions are limited to TOS or TOS-like operating systems. If an
operating systems uses a different memory layout, it will need to provide
its own functions which drivers can use.

offsets at all.
