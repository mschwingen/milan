- find_multi_device removed. The bios can handle this transparent by
  reporting a single device (with a different handle) for each function.
- the resource descriptors are back - Torsten correctly stated that they
  are necessary so that a driver can find out the length of a resource
  without writing to the config space of the card, which he is not allowed
  to (great thing, CVS :-))
- callback: the state can be set back to 'free'. Added code for 'can be
  removed without callback'.
- new: get_machine_id (Torsten's proposal)
- removed interrupt line from (un)hook interrupt. The BIOS can read this
  from the config space of the device.
